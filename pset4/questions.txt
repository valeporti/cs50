0.  JPEG supports 4.2 billion colors, GIF supports 256 colors, PNG supports 16.7 million colors and BMP supports 16.7 million colors. 
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression means that each time that a file is compressed, some image information will be lost. Lossless means that it will maintain all its information even if compressed.
3.  JPEG
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT files system, the system modifies the file name first charater indicating that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
And, the system puts the clusters used by this file in the list of free clusters.
5.  "Sanitizing through erasing" - we can do that by overwriting information in all the hard drive, we can fill it with ASCII NUL Bytes.
6.  "stdint.h" is a library that contains definitions for different definitions for specific lenghts of variables to make an easy portability between platforms.
7.  to facilitate portability
8.  Byte - 1 byte, DWORD - 4 bytes, LONG - 4 bytes and WORD - 2 bytes.
9.  First 2 bytes in a BMP file: Type of file (BMP or GIFF...)
10. "bfSize" is a type of variable concerning the BITMAPFILEHEADER and "biSize" concernig the BITMAPINFOHEADER, both same size.
11. If "biHeight" is negative, it means that the file is readed from top to end.
12. "biCompression" specifies the BMP's color depth (bits per pixel)
13. "fopen" might return NULL in copy.c:37 if it already exists a file with the same name and type
14. "fread" is always 1 because we are only reading and storing one element, the whole BITMAPFILEHEADER or the whole BITMAPINFOHEADER
15. if "bi.Widt" is 3, "copy.c:70" assign 0 to "padding"
16. "fseek" puts the "fp" pointer into a location we indicate, according to the offset we indicate 
17. "Seek_cur" indicates that we want to move starting froma the current location of the pointer
